// We can write code for two things using JS in context of web development
// 1. For browser: basic JS(loops, data types) and DOM related things
// 2. What if we want to interact with servers(A place where data is stored)
// for data sending and recieving  So, how to interact with servers

// When we search something on google then a request is send to google's server 
// then server sends the data and we see pages links
// you can see in chrome dev tools's Network tab by refreshing it
// What's request: Electro maganetic signals that tells to do something  

// JSON: JS Object Notation: A lightweight human readable data interchange format
// 1. even keys can be written in quotes and value same as js objects(if num then num) 
// if you use ,(comma) then write another key and value 

// WHy ? 
// 1. For storing data 
// 2. Transmitting data from server to client to server 

// Note: it's not language independent

// There ar two ways 
// 1. data.json() will convert data in JSON format the in JS object(useful for API fetching)
// 1. data.json() will convert JSON in JS Object (useful if data is already in JSON: AI realated work)
